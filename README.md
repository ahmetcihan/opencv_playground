opencv_playground is a software project designed to explore the basic functionalities of OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, integrated with the Qt framework for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a platform for beginners to experiment with image manipulation, video streaming, and face detection algorithms within a very simple Qt application.

Requirements: 

    C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
    Qt Creator (latest stable version recommended)
    OpenCV libraries (consult OpenCV documentation for installation instructions specific to your platform and Qt version)


Functionalities:
    
    Image Manipulation: Explore basic image processing techniques like loading, displaying, resizing, applying filters, etc. 
    Video Streaming: Stream video from an IP camera and displays it within the Qt application.
    Face Detection: Detect faces in real-time from a video stream or using a picture loaded into the application. The OpenCV face detection algorithm is used, and detected faces are visualized within the Qt GUI.
